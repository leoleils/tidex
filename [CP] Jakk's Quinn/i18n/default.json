We're investigating a couple of different diagnoses and, unfortunately, yes, I am his patient now.^^But I'm feeling hopeful. He gave me some pills for my anxiety. They're not a permanent deal, and they'll take sometime to take effect, but they'll give me the extra push I need to get better.^^For now, I'll take a step back from work. I'm conflicted... but not unhappy. Only time will tell how I'll feel about it all.^^Anyways, just wanted to let you know. Keep you updated and all that...^Again, you have my thanks.^^Quinn :)",
